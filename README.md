## Abstract
We present a framework that can impose the audio effects and production style from one recording to another by example with the goal of simplifying the audio production process.  We train a deep neural network to analyze an input recording and a style reference recording, and predict the control parameters of audio effects used to render the output.
In contrast to past work, we integrate audio effects as differentiable operators in our framework, perform backpropagation through audio effects, and optimize end-to-end using an audio-domain loss. We use a self-supervised training strategy enabling automatic control of audio effects without the use of any labeled or paired training data. We survey a range of existing and new approaches for differentiable signal processing, showing how each can be integrated into our framework while discussing their trade-offs. We evaluate our approach on both speech and music tasks, demonstrating that our approach generalizes both to unseen recordings and even to sample rates different than those seen during training. Our approach produces convincing production style transfer results with the ability to transform input recordings to produced recordings, yielding audio effect control parameters that enable interpretability and user interaction.

Simply call the `scripts/process.py` passing your input audio `-i` along with your reference `-r` and the path to a pretrained model checkpoint `-c.

```
cd <DeepAFx-ST>
python scripts/process.py -i <input_audio>.wav -r <ref_audio>.wav -c <checkpoint.ckpt>

```

## Training

### Datasets

Training and evaluating the models will require one or more of the datasets. Download all the datasets with the following. 

```
python scripts/download.py --datasets daps vctk jamendo libritts musdb --output /path/to/output --download --process
```

You can download individual datasets if desired.

```
python scripts/download.py --datasets daps --output /path/to/output --download --process
```
Note, data download can take several days due to the dataset server speeds. We recommend downloading once and making your own storage setup. You will need approx. 1TB of local storage space to download and pre-process all datasets.

For the style classifcation task we need to render the synthetic style datasets. This can be done for DAPS and MUSDB18 using the [`scripts/run_generate_styles.sh`](scripts/run_generate_styles.sh) script. 
You will need to update the paths in this script to reflect your local file system and then call the script. 

```
./script/run_generate_styles.sh`
```

### Style transfer

A number of predefined training configurations are defined in bash scripts in the `configs/` directory.
We perform experiments on speech using [LibriTTS] and on music using the [MTG-Jamendo dataset](). 
By default, this will train 6 different model configurations using a different method for differentiable .
This will place one job on each GPU, and assumes at least 6 GPUs, each with at least 16 GB of VRAM.
You can launch training by calling the appropriate 

```
./configs/train_all_libritts_style.sh
./configs/train_all_jamendo_style.sh
```
Note, you will need to modify the data paths in the scripts above to fit your setup.

There are four main configurations for training the style transfer models. 
This is specified by the `--processor_model` flag when launching the training script, and
must be one of the following:

1. `tcn1` - End-to-end audio processing neural network (1 network) with control parameters.
2. `tcn2` - End-to-end audio processing neural network (2 networks) with control parameters.
3. `proxy0` - Neural network proxies with control parameters for audio processing.
4. `proxy2` - Neural network proxies with control parameters for audio processing.
5. `spsa` - Gradient estimation with DSP audio effects using SPSA methods.
6. `autodiff` - DSP audio effects implemnted directly in PyTorch.


### Proxy training

If desired you can also re-train the neural network audio effect proxies. 
Training the controller with neural proxies requires first pretrianing the proxy networks to emulate a parametric EQ and dynamic range compressor.
Calling the proxy pre-training scripts in the `configs/` directly will train these models using the training set from VCTK.

```
./configs/train_all_proxies.sh
```

### Probe training

Linear probes for the production style classification task can be trained with the following script.

```
./configs/train_all_probes.sh
```
Note, some additional data pre-processing is required and needs updating.

## Style evaluation

Evaluating the pretrained models along with the baselines is carried out with the `eval.py` script.
A predefined evaluation configuration to reproduce our results can be called as follows. 
Be sure to update the paths at the top of the script to reflect the location of the datasets. 

```
./configs/eval_style.sh
```

To evaluate a set of models call the script passing the directory containing the pretrained checkpoints.
The following example demonstrates evaluating models trained on daps.

### Probe evaluation

Pretrained linear probes can be evaluated separately with their own script.

```
./configs/eval_probes.sh
```

### Timing 

We compute timings on both CPU and GPU for the different approaches using `python scripts/timing.py`.
